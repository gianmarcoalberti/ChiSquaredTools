Description: Comprehensive toolkit for chi-squared analysis of contingency tables.
    Includes eight analytical facilities: (1) Chi-squared testing with traditional,
    (N-1)/N adjusted, permutation, Monte Carlo, and M test (maximum adjusted residual)
    methods; (2) Post-hoc analysis with cell-level metrics including standardised
    residuals, moment-corrected standardised residuals, adjusted standardised residuals,
    Quetelet Index, IJ association factor, backwards-stepping outlier detection, PEM
    with bootstrap confidence intervals, median polish residuals (standardised and
    adjusted), Goodman-Kruskal residuals, and Difference in Estimated Proportions (DEP);
    (3) Association measures with over 20 coefficients organised by statistical
    foundation, including chi-squared-based, margin-free, and PRE measures;
    (4) Power analysis for a priori sample size determination, post-hoc power
    calculation, and sensitivity analysis; (5) Hierarchical clustering using Ward's
    method with chi-squared distance and significance testing; (6) Simultaneous
    Reduction of Dimension (SRD) for sparse contingency tables using hypothesis
    testing to merge statistically indistinguishable rows and columns; (7) Stratified
    analysis for 2x2xK tables with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, Breslow-Day-Tarone
    homogeneity test, and forest plots; (8) Stratified analysis for RxCxK tables with
    generalised CMH test, log-linear homogeneity test, and trajectory plots. Features
    toggleable method explanations with rationale and usage guidance, automatic
    significance highlighting, diagnostic decision trees, and proper academic citations.
