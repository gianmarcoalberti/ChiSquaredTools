  Comprehensive toolkit for chi-squared analysis of contingency tables. Includes
  seven analytical facilities: (1) Chi-squared testing with traditional, (N-1)/N
  adjusted, permutation, Monte Carlo, and M test (maximum adjusted residual)
  methods; (2) Post-hoc analysis with cell-level metrics including standardised
  residuals, moment-corrected standardised residuals, adjusted standardised
  residuals, Quetelet Index, IJ association factor, backwards-stepping outlier
  detection, PEM with bootstrap confidence intervals, median polish residuals
  (standardised and adjusted), Goodman-Kruskal residuals, and Difference in
  Estimated Proportions (DEP); (3) Association measures with over 20
  coefficients organised by statistical foundation, including chi-squared-based,
  margin-free, and PRE measures; (4) Power analysis for a priori sample size
  determination, post-hoc power calculation, and sensitivity analysis; (5) 
  Simultaneous Reduction of Dimension (SRD) for sparse contingency tables using 
  the Orton and Tyers (1991) method with significance-based merging; (6)
  Hierarchical clustering using Ward's method with chi-squared distance and
  significance testing; (7) Stratified analysis for 2x2xK tables with
  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, Breslow-Day-Tarone homogeneity test, and forest
  plots; (8) Stratified analysis for RxCxK tables with generalised CMH test,
  log-linear homogeneity test, and trajectory plots. Features toggleable method
  explanations with rationale and usage guidance, automatic significance
  highlighting, diagnostic decision trees, and proper academic citations.
