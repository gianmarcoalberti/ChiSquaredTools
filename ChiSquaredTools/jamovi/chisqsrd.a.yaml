        Simultaneous Reduction of Dimension (SRD) for sparse contingency tables
        using the Orton & Tyers (1991) method.
        
        Provides:
        - Pruning of categories too small to contribute meaningful information
        - Iterative merging of statistically indistinguishable rows and columns
        - Chi-squared distance-based similarity assessment
        - Significance testing for each proposed merge
        - Reduced contingency table with composite category labels
        - Detailed merge history with p-values
        
        The method addresses sparse tables where many cells have small or zero 
        counts, which inflate degrees of freedom and mask genuine patterns. 
        Unlike hierarchical clustering which merges greedily, SRD only merges 
        categories that are statistically indistinguishable at the specified 
        alpha level.
